                  Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP
                  Host header to select a HTTPProxy used to process the request.

                  Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                  hostname with 1 notable exception:

                  1. IPs are not allowed.

                  Hostnames must be verified before being programmed. This is accomplished
                  via the use of `Domain` resources. A hostname is considered verified if any
                  verified `Domain` resource exists in the same namespace where the
                  `spec.domainName` of the resource either exactly matches the hostname, or
                  is a suffix match of the hostname. That means that a Domain with a
                  `spec.domainName` of `example.com` will match a hostname of
                  `test.example.com`, `foo.test.example.com`, and exactly `example.com`, but
                  not a hostname of `test-example.com`. If a `Domain` resource does not exist
                  that matches a hostname, one will automatically be created when the system
                  attempts to program the HTTPProxy.

                  In addition to verifying ownership, hostnames must be unique across the
                  platform. If a hostname is already programmed on another resource, a
                  conflict will be encountered and communicated in the `HostnamesVerified`
                  condition.

                  Hostnames which have been programmed will be listed in the
                  `status.hostnames` field. Any hostname which has not been programmed will
                  be listed in the `message` field of the `HostnamesVerified` condition with
                  an indication as to why it was not programmed.

                  The system may automatically generate and associate hostnames with the
                  HTTPProxy. In such cases, these will be listed in the `status.hostnames`
                  field and do not require additional configuration by the user.

                  Wildcard hostnames are not supported at this time.

                    Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                     1. IPs are not allowed.
                     2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                        label must appear by itself as the first label.

                    Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating
                    dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a

                    Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a *label* must consist of lower case
                    alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric

                                        Header names are not case sensitive.

                                        Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
                                        response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                        When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the
                                        gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                        which value is present in the `AllowHeaders` field.

                                        is not included in the list of header names specified by the response
                                        header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, it will present an error on the
                                        client side.

                                        If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                        does not recognize by the client, it will also occur an error on the
                                        client side.

                                        A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
                                        The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
                                        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.

                                        When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowHeaders` field
                                        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more
                                        HTTP headers in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response
                                        header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as
                                        the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provided by the client. If
                                        the header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` is not included in the
                                        request, the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
                                        response header, instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway
                                        implementation may choose to add implementation-specific default headers.

                                        CORS-safelisted methods are always allowed, regardless of whether they
                                        are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                        When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the
                                        gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header
                                        which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                        If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                        is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                        `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                        side.

                                        The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.

                                        When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowMethods` field
                                        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                        in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                        value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                        `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                        header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                        the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
                                        instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
                                        choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                        AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                                        resource from the given `Origin`.

                                        The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                        takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

                                        Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

                                        Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                        available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                        assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                        origins. This may affect origin matching.

                                        The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                        wildcard characters behave as follows:

                                        * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                          DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                          `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                          left of its position.
                                        * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                                        An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                        from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                                        When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                        means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                        `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                        the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                        `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                        client.

                                        The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                        always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                                        If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                        the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                        cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                        403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                        the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                        Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                                        The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.

                                        When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowOrigins` field
                                        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                        in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                        instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                        `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                        the client.

                                        A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                        that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                        The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                                        `Cache-Control`
                                        `Content-Language`
                                        `Content-Length`

                                        The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

                                        When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                                        this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                                        client.

                                        Header names are not case sensitive.

                                        response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                        A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                                        to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                                        use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is
                                        unspecified.

                                        Mirrored requests must be sent only to a single destination endpoint
                                        within this BackendRef, irrespective of how many endpoints are present
                                        within this BackendRef.

                                        If the referent cannot be found, this BackendRef is invalid and must be
                                        dropped from the Gateway. The controller must ensure the "ResolvedRefs"
                                        condition on the Route status is set to `status: False` and not configure
                                        this backend in the underlying implementation.

                                        If there is a cross-namespace reference to an *existing* object
                                        that is not allowed by a ReferenceGrant, the controller must ensure the
                                        "ResolvedRefs"  condition on the Route is set to `status: False`,
                                        with the "RefNotPermitted" reason and not configure this backend in the
                                        underlying implementation.

                                        In either error case, the Message of the `ResolvedRefs` Condition
                                        should be used to provide more detail about the problem.

                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all

                                        header in the response.

                                        If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the

                                          port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                          and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                          well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                        * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                          Listener port.

                                        Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                        header in the following cases:

                                        * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                        * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                    Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                    types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                    - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                      implementations must support core filters.

                                    - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                      are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                    - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                      specific vendors.
                                      In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                      implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                      conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                      is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                      "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                    Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                    extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                    MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                    that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                    Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                    must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                    Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                    Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                    Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                  response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                  When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the
                                  gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                  which value is present in the `AllowHeaders` field.

                                  If any header name in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header

                                  A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
                                  The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
                                  wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.

                                  When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowHeaders` field
                                  specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more
                                  HTTP headers in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response
                                  header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as
                                  the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provided by the client. If
                                  the header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` is not included in the
                                  request, the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
                                  response header, instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway
                                  implementation may choose to add implementation-specific default headers.

                                  If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                  is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                  `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                  side.

                                  The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                  wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.

                                  When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowMethods` field
                                  specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                  in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                  value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                  `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                  header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                  the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
                                  instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
                                  choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                  AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                                  resource from the given `Origin`.

                                  The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                  takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

                                  Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

                                  Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                  available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                  assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                  origins. This may affect origin matching.

                                  The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                  wildcard characters behave as follows:

                                  * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                    DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                    `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                    left of its position.
                                  * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                                  An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                  from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                                  When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                  means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                  `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                  the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                  client.

                                  The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                  always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                                  If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                  the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                  cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                  403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                  the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                  Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                                  The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                  wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.

                                  When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowOrigins` field
                                  specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                  in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                  instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                  the client.

                                  to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.

                                  A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                  that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                  The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                                  `Cache-Control`
                                  `Content-Language`

                                  `Content-Type`
                                  `Expires`
                                  `Last-Modified`

                                  (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name)
                                  The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

                                  When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                                  this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                                  client.

                                  Header names are not case sensitive.

                                  Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
                                  response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                  to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                                  use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is
                                  unspecified.

                                      a ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
                                      namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
                                      documentation for details.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations must support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                              Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                    Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                    exact string match. (See
                                    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).

                                    If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                    entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                    entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.

                                    If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                    purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                    capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                    match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                    as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                    the Gateway API.

                                    Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                    themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                    Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                     1. IPs are not allowed.
                     2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                        label must appear by itself as the first label.

                    Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating
                    dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a
                    domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).

                    Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a *label* must consist of lower case
                    alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric
                    character. No other punctuation is allowed.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                          port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                          and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                          well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                        * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                          Listener port.

                                        Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                        header in the following cases:

                                        * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                        * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                          the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                    Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                    types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                    - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                      implementations must support core filters.

                                    - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                      "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                      are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                    - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                      specific vendors.
                                      In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                      implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                      conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                      is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                      "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                    Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                    extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                    MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                    that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                    Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                    must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                    Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                    Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                    Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                            match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                            to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                            of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                            Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                            matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations must support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                              Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                    Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                    case insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                    If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                    entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                    entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                    case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                    equivalent.

                                    Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                    exact string match. (See
                                    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).

                                    If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                    entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                    entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.

                                    If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                    purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                    capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                    match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                    as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                    the Gateway API.

                                    Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                    themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                    Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                     1. IPs are not allowed.
                     2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                        label must appear by itself as the first label.

                    Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating
                    dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a
                    domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).

                    Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a *label* must consist of lower case
                    alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric
                    character. No other punctuation is allowed.

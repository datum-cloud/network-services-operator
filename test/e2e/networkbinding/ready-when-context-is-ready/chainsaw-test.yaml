      description: |
        Under normal operation, a plugin is expected to move the network context
        to be ready once it has been programmed at the plugin's backend. We may
        introduce a plugin that can be used during tests so that this won't be
        necessary.

        A direct kubectl command is used as Chainsaw purposefully does not
        support updating subresources. See https://github.com/kyverno/chainsaw/issues/300
        for more details.
